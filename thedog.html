			<h3>the dog</h3>
			<p>"Tomorrow's rising star!"" --- Forbes Magazine</p>
		
			<h2>MY MOM</h2>
			<p>Where can I begin? Natalie. She's been my mom my whole life. We look a 	lot alike.
			</p>
			<p>Natty B is, at once, a shining sun and a glittering gem. Great bangs, comfy apartment, doesn't make me run, and I don't even have to pay rent. 
				</p>
			<p>But you know what? What I love most about my mom is that she has the coolest friends. Take Margaret for example. A rad, accomplished, witty urban young professional full of charm. She pets me in all the right ways. Can't get enough.
			</p>

			<h2>MY DADS</h2>
			<p>I have four. You know when you have something cool in your backstory, and you look forward to laying it on people? That's what this is for me. Not one, not two, not three --- four dads.
			</p>
			<p>For some reason, I feel the closest connection to Taco. Like he and I have a lot in common. I come from Mexican stock, and he likes Mexican food (I'm assuming). Also, he's a dog.
			</p>
			<p>David does something with vaginas.  I don't really know much from there because I don't ask. Everyone likes to pretend that their parents know nothing of the carnal world, I'm not alone in this.
			</p>
			<p>Matt's an actor. He and I share fond memories --- I'd be coming home late from a party (college, amiright?) and he'd be up late practicing for an audition. I know he's been in a few really cool films but, being totally honest, the TV scares me.
			</p>

			<h2>MY PASSIONS</h2>
			<p>I'm the kind of guy who spends his time making. Making anything. Cable-knit sweaters, art-deco ceramics, scrapbooks to commemorate family events. You can't see any of them. I don't have thumbs so nothing turns out well.</p>
