			<h3>the legend</h3>
			<p>Am I the only one who gets awkward talking about their accomplishments?</p>
		
			<h2>MY EXPERIENCE</h2>
			<p>Most recently, I managed Accounts Payable at a super hip digital marketing agency. Tell me, do you know what it's like working at a cool company doing the least cool job imaginable? It decimates the soul. I quit. I want to make stuff.</p>

			<p>I did some other stuff over the course of my long, 6-year life. I spent some time in the Caribbean, weaving baskets. I played a wood elf at a theme park. I counted votes for Gore in Florida, maybe poorly, I don't think he did very well.</p>

			<h2>MY SCHOOLING</h2>
			<p>I went to UoC. Not California, although you'd be forgiven for getting confused. I went to the majestic, world-renowned, University of Calgary. I studied accounting at the Haskayne School of Business. I regret it.</p>

			<h2>MY EXTRACURRICULARS</h2>
			<p>I make salsa! Not just for me, but as a donation to those who are hungry and in need of some latin flair. On top of my regular salsa donation, I also host the Vancouver Fajita Open. It's just me and Nat right now but I see us increasing engagmenet by 50% by 2025. </p>
